            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands allow you to tell control system what task you are trying to accomplish. There are basic and remote Git commands to learn when using this distributed version control system. Some of the basic commands are git init, git add, git commit, git log, and git status. Examples of the remote commands are git remote, git pull, and git push. Each command executes the function you desire. For example, git init will pull up an existing repository and git add is used to add files. Having a background in this terminology will allow an individual to use the full potential of the Git system and to perform the high-level operations that Git can provide.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is the way a person would access their file through means of Internet or a network. These remote repositories allow a person to collaborate with other people on a project by exchanging data between those involved. There can be several remote repositories and managing them is an important part of using Git for any work. These services entail creating remote repositories, removing those that are invalid, or renaming them. The main purpose of a remote repository is to use a repository other than local in order for people to view the changes you have made as well as the edits they have made.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is one that can be accessed by one person on the machine in which they are doing work. The edits and changes made to a project will not be shared with other individuals how they are in the case of a remote repository. This feature has a benefit of not needing the Internet in order to perform work on Git. This is not suitable if you want to share your project with others in order to show what edits and changes have been made by each person. These local repositories are managed physically and have versions of work that have not been shared with others. You can either clone an existing repository onto your computer or create a new repository in order to make a local repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is designed to handle anything from small to extremely large projects with speed and efficiency, which was developed in 2005. Git is widely and primarily used for software development. It tracks changes in computer files and coordinates work on those files among multiple people. It can also keep track of changes in any file. Git also makes it easy to work offline or remotely. The benefits of git is that everyone has their own local copy of code and can work simultaneously on their own branch. Other benefits are strong community support, built in integration and the main thing is that git works with your team.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can undo certain changes and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. Benefits to a version control system is that files cannot be overwritten, common repository holds all the latest files, people can work on the same files simultaneously and it allows you to revert back to an older version of that file. </p>
